A dynamic library is a programming concept in which shared libraries with special functionalities are launched only during program execution, which minimizes overall program size and facilitates improved application performance for reduced memory consumption.
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone,
- What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
- What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
