# Hash_Tables

This project is about hash tables. How to make one, how to use hash functions and also collisions and how to resolve them.

The tasks for this project are 7. 6 are mandatory while 1 is advanced.

# Requiered Data Structures
```
/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;
```
## compilation will be done this way
```
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89
```
